# BuffBuzz 
_A Campus Social Platform for WTAMU Students_  

## Project Overview  
BuffBuzz is a web-based social platform designed to strengthen campus connections at **West Texas A&M University (WTAMU)**.  
Students often ignore official emails but frequently check social media for updates. BuffBuzz replaces scattered communication with a **centralized, student-only network** where students, organizations, and departments can share announcements, chat, and collaborate in real time.
